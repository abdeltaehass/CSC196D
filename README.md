# 🎓 Decentralized Certificate Issuance and Verification System

## 📚 Project Overview
This project transforms a traditional centralized certificate issuance and verification system into a decentralized application (DApp) using the Ethereum blockchain. The goal is to allow educational institutions and certification bodies to issue certificates in a tamper-proof, transparent, and efficient way, while enabling public verification without relying on a single central authority.

## 🚀 Features
- Admin page to add/remove issuers.
- Issuers can issue and revoke certificates.
- Public user page to verify certificate authenticity.
- All transactions and data are stored immutably on the blockchain.
- MetaMask integration for wallet-based authentication.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- React.js (Frontend)
- Web3.js (Blockchain interaction)
- Truffle (Smart contract development and deployment)
- Ganache CLI (Local Ethereum blockchain simulation)
- MetaMask (Wallet authentication)
